    My current major is Information management and technology interested in the future of tech and how it will change the new world. Led a collaborative effort with peers to gather comprehensive functional and non-functional requirements, enabling the identification and eradication of malware within an information system. I love playing basketball and watching the NBA very much. My favorite player is Jimmy Butler and I have all his jerseys. I have 3 brothers and 3 sisters and I was born in Malaysia.
