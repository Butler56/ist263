    <!-- Main Content -->
    <main>
        <p>I was born on September 5, 2003 in Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur. Though being born in this part of Asia, I am Ghanaian which is rare in my country, and I was named after a famous Italian soccer player.</p>

        <p>
            My current major is Information Management and Technology. I'm interested in the future of tech and how it will change the new world. I led a collaborative effort with peers to gather comprehensive functional and non-functional requirements, enabling the identification and eradication of malware within an information system.
        </p>

        <p>I love playing basketball and watching the NBA very much. My favorite player is Jimmy Butler, and I have all his jerseys. I have 3 brothers and 3 sisters, and I was born in Malaysia.</p>

        <h2>Personal Information</h2>
        <p>I can be found mostly at the Barnes Center either lifting weights or playing basketball on my free time. I feel like I'm really a simple guy.</p>
